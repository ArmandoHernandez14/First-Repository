//We can do some math

4+ 10       //14
1/5         //0.2

//Modulo - remainder operator

10 % 3     //1
24 % 2     //0
15 % 2     //4

       Strings
//Single or Double quotes OK
"hello world"
'hello world'

//Concatenation
"clarlie" + "brown"  //"clarliebrown"

//Escape Characters start with "\"
"Singin \"Do wah diddy, diddy, dum diddy do\" "
"This is a backslash: \\"

//Strings have a length property
"hello world".length  //11

//Access individual characters using [] and an index
"hello"[0]  //"h" this work's cause the number
you put in it counts the work till the number
you put it and tell's you the letter
"hello"[4]  //"o"


        Excercise:
//1.
100 % 3
answer: 1, First you want to divide 3 into 100,
which your gonna get 33, then you multiply 33 by 3
,Now you get 99 , then you subtract 99 by 100 and you get 1
and that's how you do it.


//2.
("blah" + "blah") [6]
answer: a, It's A because well their added so what you want
to do is add them together "blahblah" and you start at b
but you count from zero to 6 which your gonna get A.

//3.
"hello" .length % "hi\\" .length
Hello length's is 5 % 3 , you get 3 in hi\\ because
the other \ cancels out the one next to it so you get 3, Now we
check how much times 3 goes into 5 which you just
say subtract and you get 2 and that's your answer.
