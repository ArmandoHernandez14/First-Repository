//We can do some math

4+ 10       //14
1/5         //0.2

//Modulo - remainder operator

10 % 3     //1
24 % 2     //0
15 % 2     //4

       Strings
//Single or Double quotes OK
"hello world"
'hello world'

//Concatenation
"clarlie" + "brown"  //"clarliebrown"

//Escape Characters start with "\"
"Singin \"Do wah diddy, diddy, dum diddy do\" "
"This is a backslash: \\"

//Strings have a length property
"hello world".length  //11

//Access individual characters using [] and an index
"hello"[0]  //"h" this work's cause the number
you put in it counts the work till the number
you put it and tell's you the letter
"hello"[4]  //"o"


        Excercise:
//1.
100 % 3
answer: 1, First you want to divide 3 into 100,
which your gonna get 33, then you multiply 33 by 3
,Now you get 99 , then you subtract 99 by 100 and you get 1
and that's how you do it.


//2.
("blah" + "blah") [6]
answer: H, It's H because the [6] is telling you
what's the sixth variable.

//3.
"hello" .length % "hi\\" .length
answer: 9 for the first one and 8 for the
second one and if added together it's 17 background-position
the way I got those numbers where because
.length is saying how much variables are there.
