//The two other primitives are null and underfined

//Variables that are declared but not
//initialized are undefined
//The following variables are undefined:
var name;
var age;

//null is "explicitly nothing"
var currentPlayer = "charlie";
currentPlayer = null;   //game over

note=null means Explicitly Nothing unlike undefined
which just means that there's currently nothing
in there.
